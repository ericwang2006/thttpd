      redirect - simple redirection CGI program
    </p>

    <h4><a name="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h4>

    <p>
      <code>
        redirect
      </code>
    </p>

    <h4><a name="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h4>

    <p>
      Three steps to set up a redirection:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Make sure your web server is set up to allow CGI programs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make a symbolic link from the file or directory you want to redirect,
        pointing at this program in the CGI bin directory.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add an entry to the file ".redirects" in the directory where your
        http server runs CGI programs.  For most servers, this is the
        directory where the given CGI program lives.  The format of the
        file is a bunch of lines with a filename, whitespace, and the new
        URL.  For example:
        <pre><code>
    /test/oldfile.html    http://www.acme.com/test/newfile.html
        </code></pre>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The easiest way to figure out precisely what filename to put
      into .redirects is to set up the symlink and then click on it.
      You'll get back a "404 Not Found" page which includes the filename
      as received by the redirect program, and that's what you want to use.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note: this is designed for <a href="thttpd_man.html">thttpd</a>
      and using it with other web servers may require some hacking.
      A possible gotcha is with the symbolic link from the old file
      pointing at this script - servers other than thttpd may not allow
      that link to be run as a CGI program, because they don't check the
      link to see that it points into the allowed CGI directory.

    <p>
      It would be really cool to have this program look for
      the .redirects file in the same directory as the file being redirected,
      instead of in the binaries directory.  Unfortunately, this appears
      to be impossible with the information CGI gives, plus the
      non-standardized but widespread practice of running CGI programs
      in the directory where the binary lives.  Perhaps CGI 1.2 will
      address this.
