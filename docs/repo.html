    <h3>Attack of the Repo Men</h3>

    <p>
      Just to give you folks an idea of what I have to put up with as
      manager of thttpd...
    </p>

    <p>
      On the evening of 27dec2003 I got a phone message from a
      Mr. <b>Jarrod Duffy</b>, <b>1-954-448-6980</b>.
      The next morning I got another phone message from
      Mr. <b>Shane Freitas</b>, <b>1-209-649-2300</b>.
      Both messages were full of weird accusations and threats, and were
      generally unintelligible.
      Mr. Freitas in particular is quite a mumbler.
      One of these people also phoned my parents and some of my neighbors!
      I replied to them via email.
      Here is the ensuing conversation, in full and editted only for
      presentation and privacy.

I'm guessing you meant to send the URL only once, and the right-paren
in between the two copies was another mistake.

I see a long list of domain names, none of which I recognize, followed
by a few message-board posts in a language unknown to me.  Perhaps it
is Russian.  Nowhere do I see anything connected to me.


&gt;http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd

Yes, this is a freeware package that I wrote and distribute.  Many thousands
of sites use it world-wide.


&gt;http://www.acme.com/resume.html

Yes, this is my resume.  It contains my phone number and address because
I don't mind people contacting me, unless of course they are abusive idiots.


Are you ready to explain what the problem is?

Yes, that site runs my web server, just like many thousands of

If this is what you are complaining about, then I'm afraid your
understanding of the internet is sadly lacking.  Perhaps in the
future you should find a competent professional to investigate
such things for you, to keep you from making a fool of yourself.

True, but as I have explained this is neither unusual nor particularly
interesting.  Thousands of web sites across the world lead to my web
server's page in exactly the same way.


&gt;you visited one of the websites

I have no idea why you think this.


&gt;right before you hacked it

I have no idea what this means.


&gt;and actually are a member of a forum I belong too.

I have no idea what this refers to.


&gt;Does D <i>[elided]</i> ring a bell?

No.


&gt;It was said that you know this guy.

I don't even care what this means, since hearsay is of no interest to me.


&gt;Are you saying that whoever did the hacking used software from your freeware
&gt;site?

I really have no idea.


My advice to you: seek professional help.  Either an internet professional
who can explain your various misunderstandings and help you figure out
what is actually going on, or a psychiatric therapist who can help you
deal with your paranoia and anger management problem.  Or both!

I believe our conversation is now completed, and I do not expect to
hear from you again.  No apology is necessary.  Run along and play
elsewhere.

Why?  I just want to know why?
Call me - I think I could "out do" <i>[elided]</i>'s offering(s) to you.

If your innocent, then why?
1) is your website linked to a hacker's forum written in Russian? That is
taking credit for hacking my website!  MY WEBSITE!
2) did you register at <a href="http://procra.com/">procra.com</a> defending Dave <i>[elided]</i> &amp; tag exchange,
when you aren't even a repossessor?

If you aren't directly involved, you are indirectly involved.  You know who
did this to my e-mail and website.
I can't believe a homeowner since 1985 would jeopardize his financial
well-being to help out a drunken buddy.

Call me - I left you a message!  My Cell # is <b>209-649-2300</b>.

I just spoke wiht your father at # 510-<i>[elided]</i>; he gave me the # I already
left a v/mail on.  Please - call me as I will be taking this information
to my attorney 1st thing tomorrow (monday) morning for follow up.  I really
don't want to go through a lengthy litigation process, but feel that this
matter needs to be addressed - and QUICKLY.

This constitutes harassment.  You will cease immediately or I will
file charges.

I am happy to discuss this in email.  You can start by explaining exactly
what the problem is, in full detail.  Assume I know absolutely nothing
of the background information, since I don't.  Send me all relevant
URLs and emails.  Leave nothing out.  If this is about some posts
on a message board, then send me a precise pointer to them.

I got similar mysterious accusations from one Jarrod Duffy earlier today.
Is this related?  He seemed to be a very confused and paranoid young
man.  So far you are not making a better impression.

Jef,

I wanted to walk you through the information, via the phone; that's
why I wanted to talk. But if you wish to persue this legally, we
can go that route.

I am not trying to harass you.  I want to speak with you regarding
an issue that points directly to you.  You must be an intelligent
man, to be where you are today.  I am a professional as well, and
want to discuss this in a professional manner.  Your refusal to
co-operate could be construed as an admission of guilt.

Please - phone me we we can discuss this.

B.T.W.  How did you know Jarrod's e-mail?  He phoned you, but then
you refused to call him, instead e-mailed him?  Hmn...This is
getting more interesting as time passes.

And yet you are.

Again I am happy to discuss anything via email.  I guess you are one of
those people who prefers to talk on the phone.  I prefer email, and in this
instance I get to make the decision since it is you who wants to talk to
me.  So, use email or go away.

&gt;B.T.W.  How did you know Jarrod's e-mail?  He phoned you, but then you
&gt;refused to call him, instead e-mailed him?

Caller I.D. and a reverse phone number lookup.  Duh.

Quick question:

Did you have a forwarding or routing e-mail service on acme.com at
one time? but have discontinued that?  Do you still handle incoming
e-mail's for: "cliffdiver@acme.com"?

&gt;Quick question:

I am unclear on why I should be answering any of your questions since you
have yet to explain what you are talking about, but what the hell.  I'm
a nice guy, and I'd rather play on the computer than mow the lawn in
near-freezing weather.


&gt;Did you have a forwarding or routing e-mail service on acme.com at one
&gt;time? but have discontinued that?

Yes, it was around for a few years but I had to temporarily turn it off
a couple months ago because of excessive load issues.  I expect to
turn it back on again after I upgrade my hardware.


&gt;Do you still handle incoming e-mail's for: "cliffdiver@acme.com"?

I see there is a mail forwarding account by that name.  As far as I know
it is currently disabled along with the rest of the forwarders.  Your
mail to that address should have returned a bounce message - did it?


&gt;Do you know a Dave <i>[elided]</i>?

No.


Your turn now.  Give me an exact pointer to the forum page where
this thing erupted.

you will see quite a list of allegedly "hacked" websites.  Just
below the list of sites, click on: "my playlist", which takes you
here: <a href="http://hot.ee/megadeath/playlist">http://hot.ee/megadeath/playlist</a>

bottom left, click on "thttpd/2.21b 23apr2001", and it will take
you here: <a href="index.html">http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/</a>

THE ACME WEBSITE!  Remove "/software/thttpd/ and you got Jef's
website, or Acme's website.

I am concerned because my company website www.accurateadjustments.com
is on that list of hacked websites; and my e-mail(s) are not working.

B.T.W.  Any idea what "thttpd/2.21b 23apr2001" is? on that

Yes, this is the same information that the unfortunate Mr. Duffy sent.
I explained to him why he was wrong.  Perhaps you can get him to
explain it in turn to you.

You need to give me more.  Apparently there is a discussion of this
somewhere in the forums on <a href="http://procra.com/">procra.com.</a>  Is that correct?  Point me

Hey - where did you hear about <a href="http://www.procra.com/">www.procra.com</a>?  I never mentioned
it.  Where did you hear about it?  I am on MSN with my web builder
that is speaking to Jarrod (I am told), and Jarrod says he never
mentioned it to you.  We do see where you just registered on
<a href="http://www.procra.com/">www.procra.com</a>, so thanks for looking; but where did you hear about
<a href="http://www.procra.com/">www.procra.com</a> again?

I told you - he is working with someone else.  Besides, I believe
none of what I hear (second hand), and 1/2 of what I see.  I would
rather get the info direct from the source.

There is no URL? There is no discusssion? I already gave you the
URL's that point directly to www.acme.com, but you refuse to respond
on why they point to your website; sort of evading answering the
question.  Please - I just want to know why it is pointing to your
website, so you can mow your lawn, and I can wash my cars.  It's
about as warm as it's going to get outside.  I'm in Stockton, CA.

Berkley?

Ok, you are now filtered.  If you follow up on your silly talk
of legal action, you will no doubt encounter someone who is willing
to explain to you what an idiot you have been.  When that day comes,
an honorable man would write letters (not phone calls) to my parents

Mr. Poskanzer,

  From what I have been able to gather from this BS is that some sites got
hacked into on Saturday. To what extent, I have no clue. Someone was able to
follow a entrant back to some Russian hacker forum and in clicking around
came upon a link to a site of yours.

  It just so happens that I, also in the recovery business, signed on for an
"acme" mail address sometime ago and used it to surf various industry forums
in anonymity.

  Apparently these two investigative savants stumbled on the fact that
acme.com was being used on the forum in question and also somehow linked
within this Russian forum. I spoke with Mr. Frietas by phone earlier today
and explained the connection to him. However, I don't believe he is capable
of understanding very much at all. The Recovery Industry is very competitive
and you can always tell that someone is treading water when they think
everyone is out to get them.

  Forget these guys and concentrate on your work at the Acme Labs.

Regards,

Dave <i>[elided]</i>

"I am not gay" is your best reply? (Paraphrasing of
course.)

This is the best line from the thread Dave linked to:

"Apparently these two investigative savants stumbled on

"Investigative savants." Classic. I couldnt read it all,
there was too much of it. Maybe someone else has a
different favorite?

I cant believe Freitas and Duffy wasted this guy's time like
that. Way back when Shane first posted his lame suppositions,
I followed the link to acme and immediately after reading
Mr. Poskanzer's resume knew that Shane was mistaken--this guy
is famous in certain circles. I almost replied to inform
Shane, but cancelled my post when I realized, as is
pointed out so eloquently above, he would not get it
anyway.

I had the first clue to Mr. Poskanzer's innocence is this
affair upon glancing at the name of his domain name,
acme.com. When do you think he bought that domain? Last
year? You know acme right, as in the best, the pinnacle.  As
in Wile E Coyote. As in domain is unavailable, please try
another. Geez. Acme was probably one of the first names to
be sold when
DARPA released internet technology to the public--just
after Al Gore invented it.

Mr Freitas' and Mr Duffy's exchange with Mr. Poskanzer is an
embarrasmnet to the repossession industry. On behalf of the
more rational faction of the repossession industry, however
small it may be, I extend my apologies to Mr. Poskanzer.
