      thttpd - tiny/turbo/throttling HTTP server
    </p>

    <h4><a name="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h4>

    <p>
      <code>
	thttpd [-C configfile] [-p port] [-d dir] [-dd data_dir] [-r|-nor] [-s|-nos] [-v|-nov] [-g|-nog] [-u user] [-c cgipat] [-t throttles] [-h host] [-l logfile] [-i pidfile] [-T charset] [-P P3P] [-M maxage] [-V] [-D]
      </code>
    </p>

    <h4><a name="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h4>

    <p>
      thttpd is a simple, small, fast, and secure HTTP server.
      It doesn't have a lot of special features, but it suffices for most
      uses of the web, it's about as fast as the best full-featured
      servers (Apache, NCSA Netscape),
      and it has one extremely useful feature (URL-traffic-based throttling)
      that no other server currently has.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h4>

    <dl>

      <dt> -C </dt>
      <dd>
	Specifies a config-file to read.
	All options can be set either by command-line flags or in the
	config file.
	See <a href="thttpd_man.html#CONFIG-FILE">below</a> for details.
      </dd>

      <dt> -p </dt>
      <dd>
	Specifies an alternate port number to listen on.
	The default is 80.
	The config-file option name for this flag is "port",
	and the config.h option is
	<a href="options.html#DEFAULT_PORT">DEFAULT_PORT</a>.
      </dd>

      <dt> -d </dt>
      <dd>
	Specifies a directory to chdir() to at startup.
	This is merely a convenience - you could just as easily do a
	cd in the shell script that invokes the program.
	The config-file option name for this flag is "dir",
	and the config.h options are
	<a href="options.html#WEBDIR"></a>,
	<a href="options.html#USE_USER_DIR"></a>.
      </dd>

      <dt> -r </dt>
      <dd>
	Do a chroot() at initialization time, restricting file
	access to the program's current directory.
	If -r is the compiled-in default, then -nor disables it.
	See <a href="thttpd_man.html#CHROOT">below</a> for details.
	The config-file option names for this flag are "chroot" and "nochroot",
	and the config.h option is
	<a href="options.html#ALWAYS_CHROOT">ALWAYS_CHROOT</a>.
      </dd>

      <dt> -dd </dt>
      <dd>
	Specifies a directory to chdir() to after chrooting.
	If you're not chrooting, you might as well do a single chdir() with
	the -d flag.
	If you are chrooting, this lets you put the web files in a subdirectory
	of the chroot tree, instead of in the top level mixed in with the
	chroot files.
	The config-file option name for this flag is "data_dir".
      </dd>

      <dt> -nos </dt>
      <dd>
	Don't do explicit symbolic link checking.
	Normally, thttpd explicitly expands any symbolic links in
	filenames, to check that the resulting path stays within
	the original document tree.
	If you want to turn off this check and save some CPU time, you can use
	the -nos flag, however this is not recommended.
	Note, though, that if you are using the chroot option, the symlink
	checking is unnecessary and is turned off, so the safe way to save
	those CPU cycles is to use chroot.
	The config-file option names for this flag are
	"symlinkcheck" and "nosymlinkcheck".
      </dd>

      <dt> -v </dt>
      <dd>
	Do el-cheapo virtual hosting.
	If -v is the compiled-in default, then -nov disables it.
	See <a href="thttpd_man.html#MULTIHOMING">below</a> for details.
	The config-file option names for this flag are "vhost" and "novhost",
	and the config.h option is
	<a href="options.html#ALWAYS_VHOST">ALWAYS_VHOST</a>.
      </dd>

      <dt> -g </dt>
      <dd>
	Use a global passwd file.
	This means that every file in the entire document tree is protected by
	the single .htpasswd file at the top of the tree.
	Otherwise the semantics of the .htpasswd file are the same.
	If this option is set but there is no .htpasswd file in
	the top-level directory, then thttpd proceeds as if the option was
	not set - first looking for a local .htpasswd file, and if that doesn't
	exist either then serving the file without any password.
	If -g is the compiled-in default, then -nog disables it.
	The config-file option names for this flag are "globalpasswd" and
	"noglobalpasswd",
	and the config.h option is
	<a href="options.html#ALWAYS_GLOBAL_PASSWD">ALWAYS_GLOBAL_PASSWD</a>.
      </dd>

      <dt> -u </dt>
      <dd>
	Specifies what user to switch to after initialization when started
	as root.
	The default is "nobody".
	The config-file option name for this flag is "user",
	and the config.h option is
	<a href="options.html#DEFAULT_USER">DEFAULT_USER</a>.
      </dd>

      <dt> -c </dt>
      <dd>
	Specifies a wildcard pattern for CGI programs, for instance "**.cgi"
	or "/cgi-bin/*".
	See <a href="thttpd_man.html#CGI">below</a> for details.
	The config-file option name for this flag is "cgipat",
	and the config.h option is
	<a href="options.html#CGI_PATTERN">CGI_PATTERN</a>.
      </dd>

      <dt> -t </dt>
      <dd>
	Specifies a file of throttle settings.
	See <a href="thttpd_man.html#THROTTLING">below</a> for details.
	The config-file option name for this flag is "throttles".
      </dd>

      <dt> -h </dt>
      <dd>
	Specifies a hostname to bind to, for multihoming.
	The default is to bind to all hostnames supported on the local machine.
	See <a href="thttpd_man.html#MULTIHOMING">below</a> for details.
	The config-file option name for this flag is "host",
	and the config.h option is
	<a href="options.html#SERVER_NAME">SERVER_NAME</a>.
      </dd>

      <dt> -l </dt>
      <dd>
	Specifies a file for logging.
	If no -l argument is specified, thttpd logs via syslog().
	If "-l /dev/null" is specified, thttpd doesn't log at all.
	The config-file option name for this flag is "logfile".
      </dd>

      <dt> -i </dt>
      <dd>
	Specifies a file to write the process-id to.
	If no file is specified, no process-id is written.
	You can use this file to send signals to thttpd.
	See <a href="thttpd_man.html#SIGNALS">below</a> for details.
	The config-file option name for this flag is "pidfile".
      </dd>

      <dt> -T </dt>
      <dd>
	Specifies the character set to use with text MIME types.
	The default is UTF-8.
	The config-file option name for this flag is "charset",
	and the config.h option is
	<a href="options.html#DEFAULT_CHARSET">DEFAULT_CHARSET</a>.
      </dd>

      <dt> -P </dt>
      <dd>
	Specifies a P3P server privacy header to be returned with all responses.
	See <a href="http://www.w3.org/P3P/">http://www.w3.org/P3P/</a>
	for details.
	Thttpd doesn't do anything at all with the string except put it in the
	P3P: response header.
	The config-file option name for this flag is "p3p".
      </dd>

      <dt> -M </dt>
      <dd>
	Specifies the number of seconds to be used in a "Cache-Control: max-age"
	header to be returned with all responses.
	An equivalent "Expires" header is also generated.
	The default is no Cache-Control or Expires headers,
	which is just fine for most sites.
	The config-file option name for this flag is "max_age".
      </dd>

      <dt> -V </dt>
      <dd>
	Shows the current version info.
      </dd>

      <dt> -D </dt>
      <dd>
	This was originally just a debugging flag, however it's worth
	mentioning because one of the things it does is prevent thttpd
	from making itself a background daemon.
	Instead it runs in the foreground like a regular program.
	This is necessary when you want to run thttpd wrapped in a little shell
	script that restarts it if it exits.
      </dd>

    </dl>

    <h4><a name="CONFIG-FILE">CONFIG-FILE</a></h4>

    <p>
      All the command-line options can also be set in a config file.
      One advantage of using a config file is that the file can be changed,
      and thttpd will pick up the changes with a restart.
    </p>

    <p>
      The syntax of the config file is simple, a series of "option" or
      "option=value" separated by whitespace.
      The option names are listed above with their corresponding
      command-line flags.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="CHROOT">CHROOT</a></h4>

    <p>
      chroot() is a system call that restricts the program's view
      of the filesystem to the current directory and directories
      below it.
      It becomes impossible for remote users to access
      any file outside of the initial directory.
      The restriction is inherited by child processes, so CGI programs
      get it too.
      This is a very strong security measure, and is recommended.
      The only downside is that only root can call chroot(), so
      this means the program must be started as root.
      However, the last thing it does during initialization is to give up
      root access by becoming another user, so this is safe.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program can also be compile-time configured to always do
      a chroot(), without needing the -r flag.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that with some other web servers, such as NCSA httpd,
      setting up a directory tree for use with chroot() is complicated,
      involving creating a bunch of special directories and
      copying in various files.
      With thttpd it's a lot easier, all you have to do is make sure
      any shells, utilities, and config files used by your CGI programs
      and scripts are available.
      If you have CGI disabled, or if you make a policy that all CGI programs
      must be written in a compiled language such as C and statically linked,
      then you probably don't have to do any setup at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, one thing you should do is tell syslogd about the chroot tree,
      so that thttpd can still generate syslog messages.
      Check your system's syslodg man page for how to do this.
      In FreeBSD you would put something like this in /etc/rc.conf:
      <blockquote><code>
      syslogd_flags="-l /usr/local/www/data/dev/log"
      </code></blockquote>
      Substitute in your own chroot tree's pathname, of course.
      Don't worry about creating the log socket, syslogd wants to do
      that itself.
      (You may need to create the dev directory.)
      In Linux the flag is -a instead of -l, and there may be other differences.

    <p>
      Relevant config.h option:
      <a href="options.html#ALWAYS_CHROOT">ALWAYS_CHROOT</a>.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="CGI">CGI</a></h4>

    <p>
      thttpd supports the CGI 1.1 spec.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order for a CGI program to be run, its name must match
      the pattern specified either at compile time or on the command
      line with the -c flag.
      This is a simple shell-style filename pattern.
      You can use * to match any string not including a slash,
      or ** to match any string including slashes,
      or ? to match any single character.
      You can also use multiple such patterns separated by |.
      The patterns get checked against the
      filename part of the incoming URL.
      Don't forget to quote
      any wildcard characters so that the shell doesn't mess with them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Restricting CGI programs to a single directory lets the site
      administrator review them for security holes, and is
      strongly recommended.
      If there are individual users that
      you trust, you can enable their directories too.
    </p>

    <p>
      If no CGI pattern is specified, neither here nor at compile
      time, then CGI programs cannot be run at all.
      If you want
      to disable CGI as a security measure, that's how you do it,
      just comment out the patterns in the config file and don't
      run with the -c flag.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note: the current working directory when a CGI program gets run is
      the directory that the CGI program lives in.
      This isn't in the CGI 1.1 spec, but it's what most other HTTP servers do.
    </p>

    <p>
      Relevant config.h options:
      <a href="options.html#CGI_PATTERN">CGI_PATTERN</a>,
      <a href="options.html#CGI_TIMELIMIT">CGI_TIMELIMIT</a>,
      <a href="options.html#CGI_NICE">CGI_NICE</a>,
      <a href="options.html#CGI_PATH">CGI_PATH</a>,
      <a href="options.html#CGI_LD_LIBRARY_PATH">CGI_LD_LIBRARY_PATH</a>,
      <a href="options.html#CGIBINDIR">CGIBINDIR</a>.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="BASIC_AUTHENTICATION">BASIC AUTHENTICATION</a></h4>

    <p>
      Basic Authentication is available as an option at compile time.
      If enabled, it uses a password file in the directory to be protected,
      called .htpasswd by default.
      This file is formatted as the familiar colon-separated
      username/encrypted-password pair, records delimited by newlines.
      The protection does not carry over to subdirectories.
      The utility program <a href="htpasswd_man.html">htpasswd(1)</a>
      is included to help create and modify .htpasswd files.
    </p>

    <p>
      Relevant config.h option:
      <a href="options.html#AUTH_FILE">AUTH_FILE</a>,
    </p>

    <h4><a name="THROTTLING">THROTTLING</a></h4>

    <p>
      The throttle file lets you set maximum byte rates on URLs or
      URL groups.
      You can optionally set a minimum rate too.
      The format of the throttle file is very simple.
      A # starts a comment, and the rest of the line is ignored.
      Blank lines are ignored.
      The rest of the lines should consist of a pattern, whitespace,
      and a number.
      The pattern is a simple
      shell-style filename pattern, using ?/**/*, or multiple
      such patterns separated by |.
    </p>

    <p>
      The numbers in the file are byte rates, specified in units
      of bytes per second.
      For comparison, a v.90 modem gives about 5000 B/s depending
      on compression, a double-B-channel ISDN line about 12800 B/s,
      and a T1 line is about 150000 B/s.
      If you want to set a minimum rate as well, use number-number.
    </p>

    <p>
      Example:
    </p>
    <blockquote><pre><code>
# throttle file for www.acme.com

**              2000-100000  # limit total web usage to 2/3 of our T1,
                             # but never go below 2000 B/s
**.jpg|**.gif   50000        # limit images to 1/3 of our T1
**.mpg          20000        # and movies to even less
jef/**          20000        # jef's pages are too popular
    </code></pre></blockquote>

    <p>
      Throttling is implemented by checking each incoming URL
      filename against all of the patterns in the throttle file.
      The server accumulates statistics on how much bandwidth each
      pattern has accounted for recently (via a rolling average).
      If a URL matches a pattern that has been exceeding its
      specified limit, then the data returned is actually slowed
      down, with pauses between each block.
      If that's not possible (e.g. for CGI programs) or if the bandwidth
      has gotten way larger than the limit, then the server returns
      a special code saying 'try again later'.
    </p>

    <p>
      The minimum rates are implemented similarly.
      If too many people are trying to fetch something at the same time,
      throttling may slow down each connection so much that it's not really
      useable.
      Furthermore, all those slow connections clog up the server, using
      up file handles and connection slots.
      Setting a minimum rate says that past a certain point you should not
      even bother - the server returns the 'try again later" code and the
      connection isn't even started.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is no provision for setting a maximum connections/second throttle,
      because throttling a request uses as much cpu as handling it, so
      there would be no point.
      There is also no provision for throttling the number of simultaneous
      connections on a per-URL basis.
      However you can control the overall number of connections for the whole
      server very simply, by setting the operating system's per-process file
      descriptor limit before starting thttpd.
      Be sure to set the hard limit, not the soft limit.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="MULTIHOMING">MULTIHOMING</a></h4>

    <p>
      Multihoming means using one machine to serve multiple hostnames.
      For instance, if you're an internet provider and you
      want to let all of your customers have customized web
      addresses, you might have www.joe.acme.com,
      www.jane.acme.com, and your own www.acme.com, all running on
      the same physical hardware.
      This feature is also known as "virtual hosts".
      There are three steps to setting this up.
    </p>

    <p>
      One, make DNS entries for all of the hostnames.
      The current way to do this, allowed by HTTP/1.1, is to use CNAME aliases,
      like so:
    </p>
    <blockquote><pre><code>
www.acme.com IN A 192.100.66.1
www.joe.acme.com IN CNAME www.acme.com
www.jane.acme.com IN CNAME www.acme.com
    </code></pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      However, this is incompatible with older HTTP/1.0 browsers.
      If you want to stay compatible, there's a different way - use A records
      instead, each with a different IP address, like so:
    </p>
    <blockquote><pre><code>
www.acme.com IN A 192.100.66.10
www.joe.acme.com IN A 192.100.66.200
www.jane.acme.com IN A 192.100.66.201
    </code></pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      This is bad because it uses extra IP addresses, a somewhat scarce
      resource.
      But if you want people with older browsers to be able to visit your
      sites, you still have to do it this way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Step two.
      If you're using the modern CNAME method of multihoming, then you can
      skip this step.
      Otherwise, using the older multiple-IP-address method you
      must set up IP aliases or multiple interfaces for the extra addresses.
      You can use ifconfig(8)'s alias command to tell the machine to answer to
      all of the different IP addresses.
      Example:
    </p>
    <blockquote><pre><code>
ifconfig le0 www.acme.com
ifconfig le0 www.joe.acme.com alias
ifconfig le0 www.jane.acme.com alias
    </code></pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      If your OS's version of ifconfig doesn't have an alias command, you're
      probably out of luck (but see the
      <a href="notes.html#aliasing">notes</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
      Third and last, you must set up thttpd to handle the multiple hosts.
      The easiest way is with the -v flag, or the ALWAYS_VHOST config.h option.
      This works with either CNAME multihosting or multiple-IP multihosting.
      What it does is send each incoming request to a subdirectory based on the
      hostname it's intended for.
      All you have to do in order to set things up is to create those
      subdirectories
      in the directory where thttpd will run.
      With the example above, you'd do like so:
    </p>
    <blockquote><pre><code>
mkdir www.acme.com www.joe.acme.com www.jane.acme.com
    </code></pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      If you're using old-style multiple-IP multihosting, you should also
      create symbolic links from the numeric addresses to the names, like so:
    </p>
    <blockquote><pre><code>
ln -s www.acme.com 192.100.66.1
ln -s www.joe.acme.com 192.100.66.200
ln -s www.jane.acme.com 192.100.66.201
    </code></pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      This lets the older HTTP/1.0 browsers find the right subdirectory.
    </p>

    <p>
      There's an optional alternate step three if you're using multiple-IP
      multihosting: run a separate thttpd process for each hostname, using
      the -h flag to specify which one is which.
      This gives you more flexibility, since you can run each of these processes
      in separate directories, with different throttle files, etc.
      Example:
    </p>
    <blockquote><pre><code>
thttpd -r -d /usr/www -h www.acme.com
thttpd -r -d /usr/www/joe -u joe -h www.joe.acme.com
thttpd -r -d /usr/www/jane -u jane -h www.jane.acme.com
    </code></pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      But remember, this multiple-process method does not work with CNAME
      multihosting - for that, you must use a single thttpd process with
      the -v flag.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="CUSTOM_ERRORS">CUSTOM ERRORS</a></h4>

    <p>
      thttpd lets you define your own custom error pages for the various
      HTTP errors.
      There's a separate file for each error number, all stored in one
      special directory.
      The directory name is "errors", at the top of the web directory tree.
      The error files should be named "errNNN.html", where NNN is the error
      number.
      So for example, to make a custom error page for the authentication
      failure error, which is number 401, you would put your HTML into the
      file "errors/err401.html".
      If no custom error file is found for a given error number, then the
      usual built-in error page is generated.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're using the virtual hosts option, you can also have different
      custom error pages for each different virtual host.
      In this case you put another "errors" directory in the top of that
      virtual host's web tree.
      thttpd will look first in the virtual host errors directory, and then
      in the server-wide errors directory, and if neither of those has an
      appropriate error file then it will generate the built-in error.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="NON-LOCAL_REFERERS">NON-LOCAL REFERERS</a></h4>

    <p>
      Sometimes another site on the net will embed your image files in their
      HTML files, which basically means they're stealing your bandwidth.
      You can prevent them from doing this by using non-local referer filtering.
      With this option, certain files can only be fetched via a local referer.
      The files have to be referenced by a local web page.
      If a web page on some other site references the files, that fetch will
      be blocked.
      There are three config-file variables for this feature:
    </p>

    <dl>

      <dt> urlpat </dt>
      <dd>
	A wildcard pattern for the URLs that should require a local referer.
	This is typically just image files, sound files, and so on.
	For example:
	<blockquote><code>
	urlpat=**.jpg|**.gif|**.au|**.wav
	</code></blockquote>
	For most sites, that one setting is all you need to enable
	referer filtering.
      </dd>

      <dt> noemptyreferers </dt>
      <dd>
	By default, requests with no referer at all, or a null referer, or a
	referer with no apparent hostname, are allowed.
	With this variable set, such requests are disallowed.
      </dd>

      <dt> localpat </dt>
      <dd>
	A wildcard pattern that specifies the local host or hosts.
	This is used to determine if the host in the referer is local or not.
	If not specified it defaults to the actual local hostname.
      </dd>

    </dl>

    <h4><a name="SYMLINKS">SYMLINKS</a></h4>

    <p>
      thttpd is very picky about symbolic links.
      Before delivering any file, it first checks each element in the path to
      see if it's a symbolic link, and expands them all out to get
      the final actual filename.
      Along the way it checks for
      things like links with ".." that go above the server's
      directory, and absolute symlinks (ones that start with a /).
      These are prohibited as security holes, so the server
      returns an error page for them.
      This means you can't set up
      your web directory with a bunch of symlinks pointing to
      individual users' home web directories.
      Instead you do it
      the other way around - the user web directories are real
      subdirs of the main web directory, and in each user's home
      dir there's a symlink pointing to their actual web dir.
    </p>

    <p>
      The CGI pattern is also affected - it gets matched against
      the fully-expanded filename.
      So, if you have a single CGI
      directory but then put a symbolic link in it pointing somewhere else,
      that won't work.
      The CGI program will be
      treated as a regular file and returned to the client,
      instead of getting run.
      This could be confusing.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="PERMISSIONS">PERMISSIONS</a></h4>

    <p>
      thttpd is also picky about file permissions.
      It wants data files (HTML, images) to be world readable.
      Readable by the group that the thttpd process runs as is not
      enough - thttpd checks explicitly for the world-readable bit.
      This is so that no one ever gets surprised by a file that's not set
      world-readable and yet somehow is readable by the HTTP server and
      therefore the *whole* world.
    </p>

    <p>
      The same logic applies to directories.
      As with the standard Unix "ls" program, thttpd will only let you
      look at the contents of a directory if its read bit is on; but
      as with data files, this must be the world-read bit, not just the
      group-read bit.
    </p>

    <p>
      thttpd also wants the execute bit to be *off* for data files.
      A file that is marked executable but doesn't match the CGI pattern
      might be a script or program that got accidentally left in the
      wrong directory.
      Allowing people to fetch the contents of the file might be a
      security breach, so this is prohibited.
      Of course if an executable file *does* match the CGI pattern, then it
      just gets run as a CGI.
    </p>

    <p>
      In summary, data files should be mode 644 (<code>rw-r--r--</code>),
      directories should be 755 (<code>rwxr-xr-x</code>) if you want to
      allow indexing and 711 (<code>rwx--x--x</code>) to disallow it,
      and CGI programs should be mode 755 (<code>rwxr-xr-x</code>)
      or 711 (<code>rwx--x--x</code>).
    </p>

    <h4><a name="LOGS">LOGS</a></h4>

    <p>
      thttpd does all of its logging via syslog(3).
      The facility it uses is configurable.
      Aside from error messages, there are only a few log entry types
      of interest, all fairly similar to CERN Common Log Format:
    </p>
    <blockquote><pre><code>
Aug  6 15:40:34 acme thttpd[583]: 165.113.207.103 - - "GET /file" 200 357
Aug  6 15:40:43 acme thttpd[583]: 165.113.207.103 - - "HEAD /file" 200 0
Aug  6 15:41:16 acme thttpd[583]: referer http://www.acme.com/ -> /dir
Aug  6 15:41:16 acme thttpd[583]: user-agent Mozilla/1.1N
    </code></pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      The package includes a script for translating these log entries info
      CERN-compatible files.
      Note that thttpd does
      not translate numeric IP addresses into domain names.
      This is both to save time and as a minor security measure (the
      numeric address is harder to spoof).
    </p>

    <p>
      Relevant config.h option:
      <a href="options.html#LOG_FACILITY">LOG_FACILITY</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you'd rather log directly to a file, you can use the -l command-line
      flag.  But note that error messages still go to syslog.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="SIGNALS">SIGNALS</a></h4>

    <p>
      thttpd handles a couple of signals, which you can send via the
      standard Unix kill(1) command:
    </p>

    <dl>

      <dt> INT,TERM </dt>
      <dd>
	These signals tell thttpd to shut down immediately.
	Any requests in progress get aborted.
      </dd>

      <dt> USR1 </dt>
      <dd>
	This signal tells thttpd to shut down as soon as it's done servicing
	all current requests.
	In addition, the network socket it uses to accept new connections gets
	closed immediately, which means a fresh thttpd can be started up
	immediately.
      </dd>

      <dt> USR2 </dt>
      <dd>
	This signal tells thttpd to generate the statistics syslog messages
	immediately, instead of waiting for the regular hourly update.
      </dd>

      <dt> HUP </dt>
      <dd>
	This signal tells thttpd to close and re-open its (non-syslog) log
	file, for instance if you rotated the logs and want it to start
	using the new one.
	This is a little tricky to set up correctly, for instance if you
	are using chroot() then the log file must be within the chroot tree,
	but it's definitely doable.
      </dd>

    </dl>
